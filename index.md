### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 Blackjack lab was interesting to me as i have played it before and I couldn't realy undertand it. 
But doing the code i got a better grasp of the game as me and my partner had to code the parts of it. I liked how i was able to use my prier knowledge to help
me undertand the code i was making.

* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 1 Calculating the Area of a Rectangle, was also one i liked not because of the code but because i finaly had my laptop runing so i was able to do coding at home and progress in my class.
I did enjoy a bit of the math part as it made calculating easier for thoes who would theoreticaly use the program. I would have wished we could use that for all math related issues.

* Lab 11
      Lab 11, part 1, Loved this lab because it shows how the code we write can help businesses to give information to there clients in a much faster way. 
 Which is very interesting to me as i realy like business related products that make them run smoother. code that helps others move forward is the types of code I want to make and thats what this lab reminded me.
